# Dog_classifier

In this project, I have created a dog-breed classifier powered by a convolutional neural network (CNN). 
I have built this as part of the Udacity Data Science programme. 

The classifier's main output is identifying the breed of a dog in an image provided by the user. 
An additional functionality is that the classifier also attempts to classify human faces into dog breeds. 
The classifier thus:
- detects whether a dog or human is present in an image
- if a dog is present, a breed is predicted
- if a human is present, a breed is given which resembles the human. 

The process of building the program is outline in my Medium blog post:
